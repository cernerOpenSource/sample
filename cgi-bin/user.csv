First of all I like the look of the product and the rubber pads in the bottom that gives it a good grip on even the slippery surface. It has a seagate HDD inside. Here's what I have found
DINESH DHIMAN,ACCDBEF59S6CGUYN,15-Nov-12,0,0,5 stars,WD Passport 500 GB External Portable HDD,"This is the best 500GB Portable HDD. much better than Seagate or others. Its very silent, fast and reliable! I've tested it on both USB 2.0 and 3.0 and it performs according to its specifications by WD."

Tinku,ACCDA6SHZGTT4BCC,12-Aug-12,73%,22,1 star,USB cable is problematic,"The hard disk is good looking , the design is awesome with bright red color . It is handy and extremely light weight . But the main problem lies with the connecting wire , the connector looks very weird and the computer is not able to detect properly due to some erratic connectivity .It often gets disconnected , tried with all USB ports for different laptops and same problem occurs every time."
Mukunda Nath,ACCDP6PZHMSGQUH6,23-Dec-13,0,0,5 stars,Great Product,I got this HDD from flipkart a few days ago and been using it since. It has a USB 3.0 cable and the average speed while connected to a 2.0 USB is 10+ MBPS and around 20-50 MBPS while connected to a 3.0 USB hub. The speed depends on the computer configuration so I guess it is pretty good.
Arpit Gupta,ACCDBEF59S6CGUYN,09-Oct-13,0,0,5 stars,WD My Passport 500,Got this device today. The device is very handy and can be carried in your pocket.
Sharath Vasishta,ACCDAYUMZHWCEMCV,17-Jul-13,73%,11,5 stars,Terrific!,"Got this HDD within 3 days of ordering from Flipkart. Firstly though, I was disappointed with the packaging because all other items I've purchased on Flipkart had excellent packaging. The box seemed crumpled & dirty as if it'd been tampered with, the cardboard packaging wasn't that good either. Thankfully though, the hard disk inside was safely bubble wrapped, untouched and beautiful through all the wear & tear of its protectors. :)"
ricky singh,ACCDAYUMGBSJHVYY,14-Feb-13,81%,16,5 stars,Great little pocket drive,This hard drive is gorgeous... as usually Sony makes beautiful products. The hard drive is made of brushed heavy black aluminum and it looks like it's made with top quality materials. Same hieght & width as GALAXY S2.

Sagar Singh,ACCDP6PZHMSGQUH6,28-Nov-13,0,0,5 stars,Excellent product at a very competitive price,"The product came well packed and was in excellent condition (Brand new)/ Shipping was fast too. WD elements 2TB has a total available space of 1.85TB , so do not get surprised. This is what every HDD would have (similar share lost in partitions and the binary conversion). The data speed that I tested was max 24MB/sec. Access to the contents of Hard drive (videos, songs, pictures) is pretty past. Overall a great product and cheaper than WD passport with no major difference."

Apurv Kumar,ACCDA6SHZGTT4BCC,09-Jul-13,73%,22,5 stars,NICE PRODUCT,"That was about last year when I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart. I had then paid Rs. 4806. There's been no glitch till date, of course the extra care and precaution needed to handle it is understood considering the fact that the device has no secondary protection equipment (but it's no big deal for the least price paid)."
Chethan R,ACCDP6PZHMSGQUH6,25-Dec-13,0,0,5 stars,Great value for money,"I was looking for an external hard drive to transfer heaps of data from my aging Notebook and wanted something wireless as well when this popped up. Absolutely fantastic design and it's actually smaller than it looks in the images. The cable that is supplied along with the product is equally good and conveniently sized. Transfer rates are snappy as this uses USB 3.0. If you've got the cash, just go for it."

Girish Bhagia,ACCDAYUMGBSJHVYY,21-Jan-14,81%,16,4 stars,Disappointed,"I bought it in November and it was working fine till the last weekend. When I tried to use it last weekend it was continuously getting disconnected. I tried to remove and re-connected the connection cord from my PC and it did not work. Tried the same from the external HD side and the connector socket broke. I sent the HD to your Malad centre with my office admin Pradnya and she met Ms. Shailu Singh, the Customer Support Representative. Ms. Shialu informed my admin that the HD was broken and the warranty does not cover that. When my admin called me and asked Ms. Shailu to talk to me, she only repeated one line that “You broke the HD and thus warranty does not cover it” like a parrot. She wouldn’t even let me finish my sentences or understand what the problem was, just that I broke it and warranty does not cover it."
Rahul PN,ACCDA6SHZGTT4BCC,09-Feb-13,73%,22,5 stars,Decent Drive,"Purchased this hard drive (Toshiba Canvio Basic 3.0 1 TB External Hard Disk) from one of the online store which has now been aquired by Flipkart! After doing a bit of research on different hard drives available in the market i short listed on Buffalo 1 TB USB 3 hard drive and Toshiba Canvio Basic 3.0 1 TB. Choose to go with the later since my laptop is of the same brand and Toshiba proudcts always deliver good performance and are very reliable (i also use a Suruga flash drive) Finish of this proudct is first class..Its been almost a year that i'm using this hard drive, as expected it has been very reliable and the data xfr speed is not bad at all! All in all i'm satisfied with this proudct and would definetly recommend this one if you are looking out for a decent one out there in the market."

Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment."

Mohit Sehgal,ACCDBEF5BJWM5JBX,25-Nov-12,8,8,4.6 stars,"Petite, powerful and pretty!","Now what you need out of your HD is large capacity in sleek size, good speed and well if the looks come as great, the bonus never hurts. You get all this in this wonderful little portable HD by Western Digital. USB 3.0 ensures good speed, the casing is quite sleek and the looks are just fab. The royal blue finish on the top is semi-matt with a rubberized feel making it highly presentable and elegant. The rubber finish also provides friction to keep the hard drive from slipping out of hand or off of plain surfaces. There's a bright white LED on the port side of the drive serving as the pilot light or indicator. You should have a nice time with this buy."

At first i thot of going for Seagate Go Flex..n even i ordered it on flipkart..the response frm them is at lightening speed..kudos Flipkart for your prompt customer friendliness ..but after a keen analysis i cancelled the order..the reason i turned to WD bcoz of its features and 3 years onsite service...Believe me u will never ever get disappointed after owning it. According to me the ranking and rating for top ten external HDD is as follows:

Prakash BR,ACCDBEF57FVN4CFT,27-Nov-12,86%,175,5 stars,Not worth investing money,"I purchased this drive looking at slim design and decent price. Later realised the data transfer rate was very poor. I was able to transfer was far less than others available in market. But the greatest problem is, it stopped working within 6 months. The problem is with the firmware and WD service is so pathetic, they do not accept their mistake and rectify the same. They are offering replacement disk which is refurbished one and used by someone else ! It was my mistake to trust WD storage and moving most of my kid's PICs and Videos to this drive. Analysing for some good data recovery guys to get my data backed up :("

Lithin George,ACCDBEF5BJWM5JBX,15-Jun-13,8,8,5 stars,PLUS AND MINUS,Let me just say that got this Ex HDD at the greatest price @ rs 4464. The day after ordering the price rose upto 5000+ so i was truly happy. I placed the order on saturday but i only got it on friday which may be due to the courier inefficiency. On saturday night itself the order status changed to shipped so i dont have any complaints with flipkart other than the packaging which was just a cardboard box with the device in its packet.
Himanshu Gurum...,ACCDMHDQJHVRPYAN,06-Feb-14,94%,16,4 stars,3815/- Yes I bought it for 3815 last month.,My review would be short. Because a good quality product deserves a simple short review.
Nathaniel,ACCDBEF57FVN4CFT,10-Oct-12,86%,175,1 star,A Happy First Buy,I wanted an external hard disk for quite soemtime now. I earlier had Transend n Seagate both of which have stopped working after the warranty period. I wanted to change. So after a great deal of research from the net i narrowed my choice to WD My Passport. And so far its working great. I was also a bit apprehensive after reading what some customers went through but all this was settled when i called the customer support people how were very helpful and put my fears to rest.

som srimany,ACCDH47F4H9QTDHA,06-Sep-13,60%,25,3 stars,small wonder from buffalo,"another on time delivery and smart service from Flipkart. I opted for cash on delivery. The packaging was very good. They provided genuine bill and invoice. I ordered buffalo ministation 2.5"" 1 TB hard disk on Wednesday and got it delivered on Friday. It is the cheapest, smallest, and most quiet hard disk I have ever used. Real value for money @4344/-. This drive works fine with XP, Vista, Win 7 (both 32 and 64 bit), Linux mint 11, and Ubuntu. Copying of 44 GB data (very complex directory structure varying from numerous small notepad files to huge movie clips to random photos and musics) took around 50 minutes, but a blue ray rip movie of 11 GB took only 2 minutes to copy. So, I will say speed is moderate. Not very fast - not extremely slow. It is the first day of my use of the product and hence I cannot say whether the drive gives any sluggish performance when it is nearly full. Anyway I have 3 year service warranty backup by company. Based on compact size (smaller than your wallet), quiet performance, 3 year warranty, good plug and play performance with all common OS (I have not tried MAC though), and solid but cute looks -- I will give the product 5/5."

I copied that entire 450 GB worth of data from my Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex to this hard drive in about 2 hours! That speed comparison is in my thoughts self explanatory. I bought this hard drive during the Diwali Sale on Flipkart and got it for Rs.3999. That's the lowest deal on a 1 TB hard drive I have ever seen!!!

Also the delivery boy didn't call me at all and directly delivered the product to our apartment day-shift security. When i came home, only night-shift security was available. He didn't know anything about this.such an irresponsible Delivery/Courier boy, he didn't inform me that he has delivered it to the security."

Sadanand Ray,ACCDBEF6G2AH5TWC,10-Sep-12,91%,153,5 stars,The Best of all HD drives,"Got it delivered in 4 Working days, in the best packing possible practically. Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment."

Tinku,ACCDA6SHZGTT4BCC,12-Aug-12,73%,22,1 star,USB cable is problematic,"The hard disk is good looking , the design is awesome with bright red color . It is handy and extremely light weight . But the main problem lies with the connecting wire , the connector looks very weird and the computer is not able to detect properly due to some erratic connectivity .It often gets disconnected , tried with all USB ports for different laptops and same problem occurs every time."
Mukunda Nath,ACCDP6PZHMSGQUH6,23-Dec-13,0,0,5 stars,Great Product,I got this HDD from flipkart a few days ago and been using it since. It has a USB 3.0 cable and the average speed while connected to a 2.0 USB is 10+ MBPS and around 20-50 MBPS while connected to a 3.0 USB hub. The speed depends on the computer configuration so I guess it is pretty good.

Sharath Vasishta,ACCDAYUMZHWCEMCV,17-Jul-13,73%,11,5 stars,Terrific!,"Got this HDD within 3 days of ordering from Flipkart. Firstly though, I was disappointed with the packaging because all other items I've purchased on Flipkart had excellent packaging. The box seemed crumpled & dirty as if it'd been tampered with, the cardboard packaging wasn't that good either. Thankfully though, the hard disk inside was safely bubble wrapped, untouched and beautiful through all the wear & tear of its protectors. :)"
ricky singh,ACCDAYUMGBSJHVYY,14-Feb-13,81%,16,5 stars,Great little pocket drive,This hard drive is gorgeous... as usually Sony makes beautiful products. The hard drive is made of brushed heavy black aluminum and it looks like it's made with top quality materials. Same hieght & width as GALAXY S2.

Sagar Singh,ACCDP6PZHMSGQUH6,28-Nov-13,0,0,5 stars,Excellent product at a very competitive price,"The product came well packed and was in excellent condition (Brand new)/ Shipping was fast too. WD elements 2TB has a total available space of 1.85TB , so do not get surprised. This is what every HDD would have (similar share lost in partitions and the binary conversion). The data speed that I tested was max 24MB/sec. Access to the contents of Hard drive (videos, songs, pictures) is pretty past. Overall a great product and cheaper than WD passport with no major difference."

Apurv Kumar,ACCDA6SHZGTT4BCC,09-Jul-13,73%,22,5 stars,NICE PRODUCT,"That was about last year when I purchased this hard drive from Flipkart. I had then paid Rs. 4806. There's been no glitch till date, of course the extra care and precaution needed to handle it is understood considering the fact that the device has no secondary protection equipment (but it's no big deal for the least price paid)."
Chethan R,ACCDP6PZHMSGQUH6,25-Dec-13,0,0,5 stars,Great value for money,"I was looking for an external hard drive to transfer heaps of data from my aging Notebook and wanted something wireless as well when this popped up. Absolutely fantastic design and it's actually smaller than it looks in the images. The cable that is supplied along with the product is equally good and conveniently sized. Transfer rates are snappy as this uses USB 3.0. If you've got the cash, just go for it."

Girish Bhagia,ACCDAYUMGBSJHVYY,21-Jan-14,81%,16,4 stars,Disappointed,"I bought it in November and it was working fine till the last weekend. When I tried to use it last weekend it was continuously getting disconnected. I tried to remove and re-connected the connection cord from my PC and it did not work. Tried the same from the external HD side and the connector socket broke. I sent the HD to your Malad centre with my office admin Pradnya and she met Ms. Shailu Singh, the Customer Support Representative. Ms. Shialu informed my admin that the HD was broken and the warranty does not cover that. When my admin called me and asked Ms. Shailu to talk to me, she only repeated one line that “You broke the HD and thus warranty does not cover it” like a parrot. She wouldn’t even let me finish my sentences or understand what the problem was, just that I broke it and warranty does not cover it."

After doing a bit of research on different hard drives available in the market i short listed on Buffalo 1 TB USB 3 hard drive and Toshiba Canvio Basic 3.0 1 TB. Choose to go with the later since my laptop is of the same brand and Toshiba proudcts always deliver good performance and are very reliable (i also use a Suruga flash drive) Finish of this proudct is first class..Its been almost a year that i'm using this hard drive, as expected it has been very reliable and the data xfr speed is not bad at all! All in all i'm satisfied with this proudct and would definetly recommend this one if you are looking out for a decent one out there in the market."

You get all this in this wonderful little portable HD by Western Digital. USB 3.0 ensures good speed, the casing is quite sleek and the looks are just fab. The royal blue finish on the top is semi-matt with a rubberized feel making it highly presentable and elegant. The rubber finish also provides friction to keep the hard drive from slipping out of hand or off of plain surfaces. There's a bright white LED on the port side of the drive serving as the pilot light or indicator. You should have a nice time with this buy."

At first i thot of going for Seagate Go Flex..n even i ordered it on flipkart..the response frm them is at lightening speed..kudos Flipkart for your prompt customer friendliness ..but after a keen analysis i cancelled the order..the reason i turned to WD bcoz of its features and 3 years onsite service...Believe me u will never ever get disappointed after owning it.

Prakash BR,ACCDBEF57FVN4CFT,27-Nov-12,86%,175,5 stars,Not worth investing money,"I purchased this drive looking at slim design and decent price. Later realised the data transfer rate was very poor. I was able to transfer was far less than others available in market. But the greatest problem is, it stopped working within 6 months. The problem is with the firmware and WD service is so pathetic, they do not accept their mistake and rectify the same. They are offering replacement disk which is refurbished one and used by someone else ! It was my mistake to trust WD storage and moving most of my kid's PICs and Videos to this drive. Analysing for some good data recovery guys to get my data backed up :("

Lithin George,ACCDBEF5BJWM5JBX,15-Jun-13,8,8,5 stars,PLUS AND MINUS,Let me just say that got this Ex HDD at the greatest price @ rs 4464. The day after ordering the price rose upto 5000+ so i was truly happy. I placed the order on saturday but i only got it on friday which may be due to the courier inefficiency. On saturday night itself the order status changed to shipped so i dont have any complaints with flipkart other than the packaging which was just a cardboard box with the device in its packet.
Himanshu Gurum...,ACCDMHDQJHVRPYAN,06-Feb-14,94%,16,4 stars,3815/- Yes I bought it for 3815 last month.,My review would be short. Because a good quality product deserves a simple short review.
Nathaniel,ACCDBEF57FVN4CFT,10-Oct-12,86%,175,1 star,A Happy First Buy,I wanted an external hard disk for quite soemtime now. I earlier had Transend n Seagate both of which have stopped working after the warranty period. I wanted to change. So after a great deal of research from the net i narrowed my choice to WD My Passport. And so far its working great. I was also a bit apprehensive after reading what some customers went through but all this was settled when i called the customer support people how were very helpful and put my fears to rest.

som srimany,ACCDH47F4H9QTDHA,06-Sep-13,60%,25,3 stars,small wonder from buffalo,"another on time delivery and smart service from Flipkart. I opted for cash on delivery. The packaging was very good. They provided genuine bill and invoice. I ordered buffalo ministation 2.5"" 1 TB hard disk on Wednesday and got it delivered on Friday. It is the cheapest, smallest, and most quiet hard disk I have ever used. Real value for money @4344/-. This drive works fine with XP, Vista, Win 7 (both 32 and 64 bit), Linux mint 11, and Ubuntu. Copying of 44 GB data (very complex directory structure varying from numerous small notepad files to huge movie clips to random photos and musics) took around 50 minutes, but a blue ray rip movie of 11 GB took only 2 minutes to copy. So, I will say speed is moderate. Not very fast - not extremely slow. It is the first day of my use of the product and hence I cannot say whether the drive gives any sluggish performance when it is nearly full. Anyway I have 3 year service warranty backup by company. Based on compact size (smaller than your wallet), quiet performance, 3 year warranty, good plug and play performance with all common OS (I have not tried MAC though), and solid but cute looks -- I will give the product 5/5."

Kaustav Mehta,ACCDH47F4H9QTDHA,11-Nov-13,60%,25,5 stars,AMAZING!! WORTH EVERY RUPEE SPENT!!,This hard drive is the best I have seen and used so far!! Its really fast thats for sure :-) It's average speed is about 40 Mbytes/Second !! That's on USB 3.0. On USB 2.0 High Speed speeds average about 10~15 Mbytes/Second!! I copied that entire 450 GB worth of data from my Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex to this hard drive in about 2 hours! That speed comparison is in my thoughts self explanatory. I bought this hard drive during the Diwali Sale on Flipkart and got it for Rs.3999. That's the lowest deal on a 1 TB hard drive I have ever seen!!!

Right from the moment I have opened the box, I became fan of Seagate. It is even smaller than half of the 500 GB HD Drives. Space provided is 930 GB and USB 3.0 gives transfer speeds upto 80 MBPS, blazing fast data transfer, amazing looks, compact and portable size makes it the best pick of all the available HD Drives. Flipkart has the most attractive pricing, have done quite some research in this area and found FK to be most reasonable. Overall the best HDD to buy in the 1TB Segment."

But still, these headphones are joy to wear for hearing music. Here are a few pros and cons:"
Anoop Reddy,ACCDETA3ACMWBCER,30-Nov-12,79%,19,5 stars,"one simple word ""amazing""","Hi guys I got this amazing headphones delivered by flipkart today. I have listened to beats by dr. dre, and now i am listening to sony xb-400, beats costs u around 20000. But beats cannot deliver such a bass, So I would definitely suggest you this mdr xb-400 headphones, because it is the best headphones under 2000rs. I have read many reviews on xb-400 but i was confused whether to buy or not. I couldn't stop myself to order one, and now I can say only one thing ""just go for it"" this will not disappoint the bass lovers. The audio clarity is decent, there is not much treble, but the clarity is superb as more treble will pierce your ear buds, so i would say this is the best headphones with moderate levels of treble and perfect bass. SONY rocks. If u want to compare two headphones then listen to the same song on both."
Devdatta Tengshe,ACCDEG3QDSHJABNV,01-Apr-13,92%,12,2 stars,Above Average Headphones.,"These are an mixed sort of headphones. The plug is a standard 3.5 mm audio jack with a straight Plug. I personally prefer a L Shape Plug, but this is a not a major problem. The Actual body of the headphone is partly polished glossy finish and partly black matt finish. They come along with soft plastic/ silicon ear buds in several sizes. The earbuds have a sticky kind of matt finish which is magnet for dust, earwax and dried skin. Except for the ear buds, the ear phones are classy looking, and VFM."

That's when I came across this piece of beauty. It's best for Music! (never tried these for a movie though).

Surrounding Noise is reduced considerably. Best when used with ipod and PC/LAPTOP Music."

Ankit Vasudevan,ACCD55RCHQKQFCYU,24-Apr-12,91%,35,5 stars,"The Sennheiser HD 180 - Great Brand, Good Product","I had been using sappy I-Pod earphones in my laptop for quite a while until i got absolutely fed up and decided to get a decent pair of headphones. Not being a fan of earphones, i set out searching for a pair of circumaural headphones (in the Rs. 950 to Rs. 2000 range) and ended up settling for the HD 180's (owing to my sennheiser bias). Am a music junkie through and through but by no means am i fussy bout headphones. As long as the headphones provide clear sound and are comfortable, i'm good. The HD 180's do just that. It looks decent and has a huge cord (which i like). Cuts off external noise to a noticeable extent. Provides clear sound (IMO not recommended for people who listen to loud bass music). As for the tech specs, i am not really too aware of the implications of frequency response or sound pressure level sort of thingies so will steer clear of those aspects of the review"

It is light-weight, which means my neck doesn't feel any strain even if I run with them on. It is economical, which is why I could afford it with my not-so-satisfying pocket money. It is stylish, so I don't shy away from carrying it anywhere and everywhere. And, what's more, It is a Sony innovation, which means it has an undoubtedly long life. But, the glitch is, it lacks a volume controller, which ofcourse wouldn't be a problem if you have a nice walkman or an Ipod. Otherwise, for rash everyday use it is worth every penny. What's more, it also leaves you pocket happy, especially if you are a teenager who survives on a meager pocket money."

It produces an appreciably clear sound, you can hear every string pulled and every drum beat distinctly. However the bass, though clear, is not strong and so i don't recommend this pair of headphones to those who are looking for a rich base. The ear pads are really comfortable and the design is quite ergonomic, thus allowing for prolonged use without any discomfort. However, i must say that the not so loud bass has to play a role in this aspect. The plastic quality won't disappoint as well. To sum things up, this is a good headphone with a very decent base and is being sold at a good price."

Contrary to previous reviews, these earphone have no problem with the bass, treble or any part of the sound. It's sound isolation is not a marketing hype; you really can't hear anyone else, and sometime yourself, when you play a song at a relatively high volume. The only downside of these earphone that I have found is the wires. The wires are very thin and are prone to internal damage if not used carefully. But overall the Pros out way the cons by a tonne and i recommend these earphones to anyone who is looking to great earphone with a tight budget.(Y)"

Aurora Chloris,ACCDHAZTSXFNYVKH,06-Sep-13,3,4,5 stars,outstanding product!!!,"i dont have enough words to describe this wonderful product at rs 99 (by priyali) . while i read reviews on this product, where most of the people had written good comments, i was thinking they might be just promoters of the brand since it is being sold at a throw away price. but since i was low on cash i thought of trying this product...! the product reached me within 4-5 days very fast and prompt service..! very satisfied with the product. loud sound and quite clear...! this product comes with a pair of extra ear bud. so if you are low on cash and want a great pair of earphone for yourself... GO for this...!"
Ajay Dyas,ACCCY2APZ5482MQQ,16-Oct-13,95%,21,4 stars,Mediocre,The headphone is bang for the buck for sure but dont be swayed by the overzealous reviews of people who just purchased the product.
Aryan,ACCDFE7NE2PNQAPR,26-Apr-12,90%,96,5 stars,Got what i'v been looking for...,First of all Philips headphones are the once whom i'v been using since a long time & i trust Philips only..i have many music accessories of philips only...
Navi,ACCCY2APZ5482MQQ,25-Aug-13,95%,21,3 stars,Good sound but don't think the product lasts long,Based on the reviews I selected this one from the short list. This is my second set of headphones. I already have a Philips headphone bought more than five years ago. So let me present this review as a sort of a comparison.
Kartik Iyer,ACCDAXKT8S9YHGSR,07-Oct-12,92%,39,4.5 stars,Ultimate pair of Headphones!!!!,"Hey guys, i just bought these amazing pair of Sennheiser HD 202II yesterday and have been constantly using it since then!!! It fits comfortably and sound output is simply mind-blowing!!! I had two options in mind, they were either the HD 202II or the JBL Tempo On-ear.. I tried out both and both were really good.. They both cost around the same and also their specs are close enough. The sensitivity in JBL Tempo is around 112dB/mW and whereas its 115dB/mW in HD 202II. But frankly both provide really good powerful output. The noise-cancellation in HD 202II is way better than the JBL Tempo(since it has a massive ear cushion). Another flaw that I found out with the JBL Tempo is that if you are listening to music in a silent environment, its audible even to people around you(this doesnt mean that JBL has a better output). The JBL Tempo comes with a carry pouch which may come handy. 1 thing that bugged me is that the HD 202II has an awfully long wire(10ft). I personally found that unnecessary. Anyway they do provide us with a small plastic case to wind the wire which you can clip on your belt or pocket. 1 more important thing before concluding my review, JBL comes with 1 year warranty whereas Sennheiser comes with 2 yrs international warranty."

After a lot of research, my search narrowed down to Steelseries 4H, Sennheiser HD 202 II. For around Rs. 2000, which was my budget, I think that if you are searching for gaming only headphones, don't go for it. It does provide nice surround sound but the 3D effects are not so clear, specially when it comes to listening noises coming from below or above you in some maps of CS. Enemies can be spotted left or right easily but it could be better..."

Nithin,ACCDDEHYDJEQQXTF,03-Feb-14,92%,13,5 stars,Its just average...,"The main reason why I bought this headphones coz of the no.of positive reviews and lot of praise for its bass. Thing is that I have bought it around 1.5 yrs back, thought of giving it a review now to help others looking to buy it. First of all, there is nothing great with the bass, its just ordinary as any other earphones in this range. Quality and build was very good I thought initially. But now it has started to give some problems. Now the volume of the earphone has gone down drastically and I have to twist or touch the end of the earphone where the 3.5mm jack connects to make it sound properly, and if I move the earphone or keep it in my pocket again same issue happens. Its out of warranty and I am not planning to get it paid repaired. For someone whos looking for earphones in this range, I would suggest Sony. They have excellent build quality and long lasting. I have a Sony earphone in the same range which I am using for almost 3 years without any problem."

That's when I realized that the battery life depends very much on your use. Once you charge the battery, you should discharge it completely.

All of a sudden today, just after 11 months its performance is degraded. Battery back up is not even lasting for 5 minutes. I again mention this is all of a sudden. I think HP is looking to cash on batteries. Not at all a good battery. But it is inevitable for HP users."
Pravimal Abhishek,ACCCZZC89EZHX4QK,04-Nov-11,83%,12,1 star,DO NOT BUY DELL,"This is the third time I'm buying the battery for Dell laptop.

About the battery back up, it started with 4 hours and has reduced to 40 min after 2 and a half years. And this is the first time i have replaced it. So I dont think product quality is at question. every battery has a chargring cycle, generally 10000 battery charge cycles. In case you overcharge the battery you just end up burning the battery. so goes your backup. just ensure that your battery is not plugged in in case you have switched off the laptop after a full charge. Your battery will run just fine. As far as flipkart is concerned, exceptional service!!"

Leon Corriea,ACCD6XDPHFDV4XYB,31-Jul-12,93%,60,5 stars,Buy at your own risk.,"I would advise caution before buying this product. I bought it a month ago and started using it two weeks back. Within ten minutes of normal usage, there was a short circuit inside the battery and I could smell something burning. Next thing I know, the laptop stops working and I haven't been able to use it since then. I'm worried I might have to shell out a bomb to fix my laptop now. Luckily for me, the battery is still under warranty and maybe this was an isolated incident. However, I would be highly skeptical about the replacement unit as well."

MD,ACCDN38RSTEDWFWG,30-Dec-13,1,1,3 stars,Not so good,The battery deteriorates pretty quickly. as of now battery wear is 23.2%. It will be unusable after 50%. Better buy a branded one that lasts longer.

I had been using my laptop on my supplied battery for about 30 months smoothly untill the back-up time reduced to 15mins(that to with ATI graphics switched off).

All my associates who have listened to the sound of Digiflip has confessed that the sound quality is outstanding. Above all my brother-in-law has taken away my Digiflip. Unfortunately, I've to order for DBEST. I would like to purchase Digiflip again if it reaches your stock"
Sanyyam Sood,ACCDH8AVYXCJVY4E,21-Jul-13,1,1,5 stars,Awesome speakers (Wont be any better option in such a price),"Dear friends, i have used a number of speakers such as creative 5.1, iball 2.1 and altec lansing 2.0. Till now altec lansing 2.0 have been the best sound producing machine for me."
niks,ACCD7CXH9YHZQ2KU,20-Jan-14,2,2,5 stars,Not completely satisfied,"I was expecting better sound quality. Bass is almost non-existant, but this is expected as there is no subwoofer. Could have been done with a better treble response. Loudness is satisfactory."
Hemant Singhal,ACCDNC7RRUMDCDYZ,06-Feb-14,0,0,3.4 stars,Mini DJ!,When I bought it for a deal price of 350 Rs. I did not expect them to be so good. They are great in sound quality.
Abhishek agrawal,ACCDYEZPBJUEHHC6,20-Aug-11,97%,29,4.3 stars,good experience...,the speakers are really cute and efficient and the price tag is all the more reason for go to it.i can safely say that you won't be dissappointed.flipkart's service is the best among all online shopping portals...
Jithin Mathew,ACCDHYHRFYZ8RHDU,29-Jan-14,2,2,5 stars,Good value for money,"The speaker delivers what is expected of it. Good sound quality over bluetooth. Bluetooth range is good and connecting is a piece of cake. Charge also lasts good enough. The only disadvantage is that no volume control exists in the speaker itself, volume can be controlled only through the device."
Karthick R,ACCDH8AVYXCJVY4E,17-Oct-13,1,1,4 stars,Waste of money. Not worth buying,"After reading all the positive reviews, bought this product last month (September) for home PC. Hardly used it for a week with low volume.Recently when I switch on the computer to watch a movie, heard a weird sound from the speaker. I thought someone might have disturbed the wires hence there might be some connection issues. But after checking the cables got disappointed. All the cables are fine. The weird sound is from the speaker even in the low volume. When the volume is increased it is getting worse. Tried changing the properties for volume. Nothing helped. Finally I ended up spending 500 bucks for a faulty product. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Better spend some more money and buy a quality product."
Niraj Karamcha...,ACCDNC7RRUMDCDYZ,01-Feb-14,0,0,5 stars,About speakers,not so good.. only kaam chalau.. expected far more than this from Digiflip.. Speakers not performing good at high volume.. voice is terrible at high pitch.. so these speakers are not for those who enjoys music at high volume.. You can only buy them if u wanna use them to watch a movie on laptop at mid volume.
Karan Agrawal,ACCDYEZPBJUEHHC6,15-Sep-11,97%,29,4 stars,Very Good Speakers At This price,"The speakers are excellent for laptop, they give good sound quality considering their size as well as price, weight is about 300gms(not very light). Before ordering these speakers I researched about the price on other e-commerce sites selling these speakers and the closest price was Rs.32/- more than Flipkart's price and one has to buy 20 pieces of these speakers(yes a single piece cannot be bought), other's price was about Rs.200/- more than Flipkart's price."
disspointed bu...,ACCDDTF4WYBEV8N6,01-Oct-12,97%,32,2.7 stars,do not buy this speaker..please according to me..:(,woofer is not good at all my creative 2.1 produce 90% batter than this .. i brought this product 3 months ago because of brand philips. but this product was just a piece of junk .firstly it has connection issue then remote was faulty when it came over these problems thanks to service center then the big disappointment the sound quality..
Neeraj Agrahari,ACCDH8AVYXCJVY4E,18-Aug-13,1,1,1 star,Good Speakers but Price,I have heard these speakers and they are really good. If you have budget below 500 you should go for it. My friends bday is coming soon .. I am going to gift him this as this is very good option fr a gift.

Not even in a 10x10 room...Absolutely no poin in buying this. Its remote causes issues within a month and getting a replacement for it was also not possible. The philips website itself doesnt have this model...
ARUN A%20G,ACCDFZEJM7CBGAFZ,29-Sep-11,5,5,3.1 stars,More Value for what U Pay!!!,"Superb sound clarity with treble and Good Bass also. I have been using INTEX 2.1 Sub Woofer for past 5 years and this is the second purchase. I am very much satisfied with the 2.1 Speaker with Sub small sub Woofer. U get a 2.1 for the price of 2.0. If looking for a good speaker with super clarity and good bass, go for this."
Ulfet Tirmizi,ACCCZZC9BDUM4EXE,10-Nov-11,94%,79,4.6 stars,My first speakers and they are awesome!!!,"I know nothing about electronics. I just wanted something that sounded great. After asking friends, the majority said Creative is a good brand. Then came the decision between 2.1 and 5.1 (where 2 and 5 are the number of small speakers and the .1 is the sub-woofer or the big black box). I decided to go with 2.1 as I have a small house and didn't want the clutter of 5 speakers around me."
Shubham Ghadage,ACCDH8AVYXCJVY4E,10-Sep-13,1,1,4 stars,Amazing!!!!!!,"I am a Hostel Student and a frequent traveller from Home to hostel. Meanwhile i was looking for a descent speakers for my Samsung galaxy Tab and while searching for one I discovered iBall SoundWave 2 Multimedia Speaker 2.0. Going by the price and its portability i hurriedly placed an order and recieved it within 36 hours of my delivery. i was Dumbstruck by the Delivery Service Flipkart had to offer. Talking about the speakers they are value for money. Quality Sound, Easily Portable and moreover easy on ur pocket-money or monthly allowances. I would recommend this if u looking for a decent choice below 600 Rs/-."

Deepak Khajuria,ACCDFZEJM7CBGAFZ,21-Jan-14,5,5,5 stars,WORST PRODUCT,Hey guys never ever think of buying intex company speakers.
Shiben Bhattac...,ACCCZZC9BDUM4EXE,19-Sep-11,94%,79,5 stars,Satellites got quite a paaanch,Usually in 2.1 systems the Woofer is crazy woofy and the satellites are two mice running around waiting for attention. uh oh.....
Suneel Sonti,ACCDHYHRYYHUJWH4,26-Jul-13,3,3,4 stars,Small yet strikingly powerful,"It was a complete shocker when i played the first song on it after pairing it up with my androids Bluetooth.... AMAZINGLY LOUD & CLEAR.The color of the actual product i received is full black. As described it has both usb input and av connection on it. I am not an audiophile so i cannot comment on the lows , bass and other stuff, but this pretty much is more than what i expected before investing that 1099/- INR in it. Worth every penny spent."
Utkarsh Singh,ACCDYEZPBJUEHHC6,07-Nov-11,97%,29,4 stars,Really good value for money!,I wanted a portable set of speakers as its convenient to carry them & the default speakers in my laptop are pretty much inadequate for any purpose. These Zeb speakers produce a really loud sound. Clarity is good considering the price. You've to connect both the usb & audio jack to listen to them. There is a small but very useful volume adjustment knob on the back of one speaker. Look wise they are tiny & look cute & its easy to place them on a cramped table. Overall they offer a reasonably good listening experience specially considering their price & size.
Mayank Meena,ACCDDTF4WYBEV8N6,28-Sep-13,97%,32,1 star,Waste of Money !!,"Please don't buy this product at all. Even my LED TV gives better sound output than this. Especially the sub-woofer, it is just a box of no use."
Gopala krishnan,ACCDFZEJM7CBGAFZ,22-Aug-13,5,5,1 star,very bad speakers,i am very disappointed with the speakers. the volume is very low and in one of the speakers something is moving while shaking.comparing the output it is very much low than my laptop or mobile. when i called flipkart the response is very bad and they told nothing can be done from their side and asked me to contact the brand or manufacturer
Balamurugan J,ACCCZZC9BDUM4EXE,14-Dec-11,94%,79,5 stars,Value for the money,"I have owned quite a few desktop speakers (Altec lansing, creative etc) and also high end hi-fi speakers (monitor audio gold, def tec, velodyne etc). As far as desktop speakers go this one is by far the best in terms of midrange clarity even though I find it a bit too crisp at times. The bass may not be the best but it can be tamed with the subwoofer volume control. I did back and forth comparisons with the older desktop speakers I have and this speaker certainly produces the vocals with more conviction and also picks up more details from the audio track, except for very deep bass which no one should expect in these systems. Listening to uncompressed audio files was a real delight in these."
Dushyant Prakash,ACCDHYHRYYHUJWH4,14-Aug-13,3,3,5 stars,Simple and great,"This was one of the impulsive purchases on Flipkart. I had planned for a weekend break to a place with no tv etc and therefore wanted portable speakers. I took a gamble on Digiflip and it paid off. No complains for the price, works excellent. I have started using the speakers in my room now. Sound clarity is great is great, and so is the bass. Because this is blue tooth, even my wifely can play music through the laptop/or her phone. The product looks much bigger on screen and has a nice black appearence."

When i played the song it sounds too good. We cant expect more than that for this much low price. i bought this speakers for my mobile which i bought from flipkart only. it plays good and i am very happy about the sound, bass etc., Worth getting at low price."

Saurabh Kumar,ACCD5QY5SK7JWNFZ,09-Aug-12,6,7,3.7 stars,Complete waste of money. Please do NOT go for this.,"I have ordered this speakers few days back and disappointed with this.

Vinod Sankaran...,ACCDHYHRYYHUJWH4,01-Sep-13,3,3,5 stars,Excellent product,The delivery took a little longer than normal Flipkart standards. But the product is a little beast.

Amish Aggarwala,ACCCZZC9MF2XR4JE,06-Aug-11,88%,49,3.6 stars,very very crappy!!,"there's a reason these are priced less than what a decent pair of earphones will cost you. God knows what I was thinking while placing an order on flipkart. The site does the job, delivery is always great and on time. But Creative should end itself before coming out with this s^#*. Sounds like a torn radio transmitter from the 60's. Really sad you know, a small 256 mb creative mp3 player which i bought 8 years ago is still as good as new and is still better than my 30gb video ipod(collecting dust somewhere in my table)when it comes to audio output"
Annabel Bayer,ACCD5QY5SK7JWNFZ,15-Aug-13,6,7,3 stars,Meets expectations,"This is a good product for the price. It's 2.0 and does not have a woofer, so don't expect too much bass. Though if you have a good bass booster on your online player, it can produce a pretty deep sound. No complaints - it does what it says it's gonna do. Clear sound, loud enough to fill the room, perfect set of travel speakers for your laptop!"

Chitransh Agrawal,ACCCZZC9DFRHZTZX,05-Dec-11,93%,30,3.9 stars,Try Creative A335,Friends these are nice speakers but i still want you to go for A335 available for about 400 bucks more than this one.It is a one time investment so why not go for something that is not just good but awesome.
muneendra bhar...,ACCDYEZPKWVEKVTU,05-Sep-11,72%,68,3.7 stars,worst buy ever,u can burn your 520 bucks ike i did. these speakers have a very small freq respone range. the bass makes clattering sounds even on low base songs. i packed them again agter i heard 2 -3 songs and will most probably never take em out. i may even give them to an auto wala guy. i lodged a complaint about the product but never got a call back.
Dinaka,ACCD5QY5SK7JWNFZ,27-Jan-14,6,7,4 stars,Good buy,"These speakers are good, real compact & worth the buy......... ideal for a small workspace desk."
Sachin Nayak,ACCDEVVF8NQ29AT4,26-Nov-12,9,9,5 stars,Decent Product for its price,Was looking for an FM Radio player which could double up as add-on speakers to ipad/iphone at home and zeroed in on this one.

Balasubramania...,ACCCZZC9MF2XR4JE,27-Oct-13,88%,49,5 stars,Decent Speakers External powered speakers,"Initially after seeing low rates for Zebronics and Frontech, I first ordered Zebronics speakers from another retailer and they gave me a broken product. Next I decided to order Frontech 2.1 USB powered speakers from Flipkart and they delivered a defective piece. I was so Frustrated, I went to a local shop, played some songs & got a feel and then I got these speakers. I am currently using Creative 4.1 and its too good. So I trusted in the brand Creative and I had enough of local brands."
abhishek ghosh,ACCCZZC9DFRHZTZX,29-Aug-11,93%,30,3 stars,good speaker,"It is a good speaker,fine sound, just like a creative speaker has to be, but the only issue i have is that this does not have a Bass controller.I have to adjust the controls from the laptop."

The product could not be delivered at my office, so they arranged a home delivery. Don't usually expect such decent customer service in India (no offense to anyone). About the speakers, as I said, completely worth the cash I shelled out. The volume does not crack at maximum level thus, does excellent for a mid-sized room. However, the base has to be controlled with the help of the player on the computer. I found real player better for using these speakers. Thanks once again Flipkart. You rock, and your advertisements too!"

The service by flipkart was super fast. I previously used a creative SBS 245 stereo. and seriously wanted to get something in Creative only. searched everywhere but no speakers to match that bass or even clarity. As soon as i got these speakers and played my favorite track on these speakers i was MIND BOGGLED. the bass response is so deep and booming that no speaker can match that quality. the clarity is very good, they are affordable, and as i am an complete BASS-O-HOLIC, these stereo are INSANE. Loved this Thanks Creative and thanks Flipkart."

Rajneesh Pandey,ACCDFZEJ2ZHYHX4T,12-Mar-12,8,10,1 star,Not so good,"I have just received the product from flipkart. The service of flipkart is best as usual, but the speaker quality is not as per expectation. Thought that it will be quite good irrespective of a small budget speaker but surprised to see that sounds like a radio. But the advantage is that it has volume control as well as headphone jack. I will not recommend this product to anyone. If you are on a tight budget just spend a few bucks to get a good speaker and not this."
Praisen Elias,ACCCZZC93FANSHUV,21-Apr-12,87%,15,4 stars,Great Product..But no use for warranty as Creative has no proper customer service in India...,"I bought this for 950 Rs about 8 months back...Love it...Good for small rooms...Only issue i had with it was that the transformer blew inside the woofer during a really bad voltage fluctuation...but a lotta electronics in our area was affected in that fluctuation...including a 7000Rs speaker system...so cant blame that on the speaker...but my issue was that when I tried contacting the Creative people for repair cuz i had warranty, I discovered that both the local and national Customer Care numbers given on various sites were no longer in service...and it cost me more than half the price of the speaker to get that particular transformer replaced as transformers with this one's particular ratings were hard to find..!"

The mids and highs were acceptable while the ""real"" bass just isn't there. Expecting anything more from such a product is no go. Convenience is what makes this a user-friendly set.

Murali Raju,ACCDCZXZC6UFV3PT,10-Sep-12,95%,21,4.6 stars,WOW Factor,"I was looking for a speaker system for my LG 32 inch LED TV installed in my bedroom as the inbuilt TV speakers are not upto the mark. Explored many options including Home theatre systems. As I did not want a DVD player, I narrowed down my search to ONLY SPEAKERS. I came across this model in the Sony Brandshop where I had gone 2 look for a Soundbar speaker (costs Rs 19,990/-). After listening 2 this product at 1/4th cost, I made up my mind & went for it. The speakers are really good & the sound quality is as usual, SONY quality. The system has two input modes, One 3.5mm stereo pin input & the other RCA Audio in (Rt & Lt channels in). So you can connect two devices at a time. In addition the USB port can be used to play music from usb drives (can sense the micro sd card in a mobile phone too). I tried pendrives upto 32GB on the system."
Harish Gangadh...,ACCD4AVP8Z92SHZP,27-Jun-12,9,10,3 stars,Crystal clear,"For a small Hostel room, these are ultimate speakers, the stereo effect is superb. Audio is crystal clear and USB power option is really good for laptops.I duly recommend this product and as always flipkart service is the best"
Dibash phukan,ACCDHYG8DR4CMCJN,07-May-13,6,6,1 star,simply superb.,"I must say my decision to buy this speaker was absolutely right as it never disappointed me till now.Good bass though treble should have been there.But who cares when it is within 1200k.Crystal clear sound when you hear in your mobile and the quality gets better when you switch to a PC.And what to say of Flipkart's delivery.You people all know about it.Good packaging.Arrived within 3 days from ordering.To sum up,if you are thinking of buying a Sub-woofer within 1200k,then go for it without have to think much as iball will never disappoint you,if you compare with the other rivals at the same price range."
Mayur Bhosale,ACCDCZXZC6UFV3PT,29-Jan-13,95%,21,4 stars,Best at it's budget!,"First of all, thanks to Flipkart once again! It's my second online purchase from Flipkart and as is known flipkart is a very good online shopping destination. Well,,,um-received my package this afternoon i grabbed it to home and unloaded all the stuff inside instantly, i put two small speaker(may be satellite's; they call it) on my PC desk, plugged in everything, booted my computer then fired up Windows Media Player. First Mp3 i hit was David Guetta's - Turn me On => as soon as i clicked it....BOOOOMMMMM......Dhappaak Dhappaak......it was like love at first beat! Bass is awesome MAN!.......... i didn't expected such a performance from this! i was quite sure it would perform well as it's by SONY and yeah! it's more than what i thought!"
Avishek Das,ACCDHYG8DR4CMCJN,11-Jun-13,6,6,5 stars,decent performer,"stylish, light n full wood cabinets, but otherwise mediocre in performance. the wooden box gives the sound a different ambience compared to ones with plastic casing, but its not necessarily better. depends on listener's choice. the bass and treble are both good/average for the price range (good if I consider the discount in price right now). if you to are getting a 10% discount while buying this, at a price of less than 1000rupees, by all means go for it!"
Satheesh,ACCDCZXZC6UFV3PT,17-May-13,95%,21,5 stars,Good speakers for its price,Don't get excited after reading all these reviews if you are a hard music lover. I admit that this one is the best 2.1 below Rs 5000. Its bass is good enough to shake a small room especially if you are on gaming. It is also good for movies if you don't want a 5.1 setup. For music also this is the best PC 2.1 I ever met.
P.B.Singh,ACCDHYG8DR4CMCJN,05-Jul-13,6,6,4 stars,Extraordinary Product at its price,"Extraordinary Product and value for money as i got it in just 1080 bucks.. i got it within 2 days from the order date.. nicely packed & delivered.. Excellent product from i ball.. sound effect is spectacular,mind blowing. Speakers are looking pretty decent as its body nicely framed with wooden box...."
Ayon Ghosh,ACCDCZXZC6UFV3PT,31-Dec-12,95%,21,4 stars,Excellent bass clarity,"These are the costliest speakers I bought till date, and believe me, these are mind-blowing. The first thing you will notice is the bass--it's powerful, punchy, crystal clear and distortion-free; you can turn up the volume all the way but still the subs don't mask the mids and treble. I can hear details in the bass range I've never experienced before, not even with good quality headphones. Tried all kinds of music--classical (Indian and Western), pop, rock, new age, electronica, soundtracks. Movies sounded like I was in a theatre. With these speakers I was able to fully experience the power of the orchestra. You will also be able to distinguish between 128kbps and 320kbps MP3 with this monster. The only aspect I'm not too happy about is that the cables provided in the box are not very long, hence it might be a little difficult to position them wide enough. I am rating these 4 stars as I haven't tried costlier ones, but quality-wise the Sony SRS-D9 2.1 are the best I have heard."
Abhay Singh,ACCDCZXZC6UFV3PT,19-Sep-12,95%,21,4 stars,Great speakers,"I got these speakers from a local store last night, and I love the overall quality and value for money. These are my opinions:"

shashank singh,USGDRHZAY4KT4AEH,30-Jan-14,0,0,1 star,Raspberry PI,Used this with Raspberry PI and the amount of noise it introduced during simple recording was just mind boggling and rendered whole thing useless.
Anirudh Sharma,USGDHE59FKNPTADE,03-Jan-14,1,2,3.9 stars,Serves Its Purpose,"The Soundcard I received was of good quality seems robust and unbreakable,well the usb part is a bit delicate but it will only break if you apply a lot of pressure.The device is smaller than a pendrive and is very light and it has an led which blinks when it processes audio.You can also use this device and your default soundcard for having two different outputs"

Giridhar Vijay,USGDRBZ9KFPVC7CK,20-Jan-14,0,0,5 stars,Superb!,"Small, cute and useful. Helpful for my TAB, to connect mouse, keyboard and a pendrive. Useful for charging mutiple devices also. Mini usb cable included can charge other phones too."
Diljit Singh,USGDHE59FKNPTADE,30-Dec-13,1,2,4 stars,Pathetic Product...!!!,When Internal Sound card of my Netbook gave up I had to buy external one. I ordered this from flipkart and costed me like Rs 200 I suppose.
Tauseef Hussain,USGDHP6ZZMVHYWT9,20-Sep-13,5,5,1 star,Bought it. Could not use it since day 1 as it does not work.,"The USB connector does not work. Tried on on a PC and a Laptop with pen drives, phone as well as a External drive. Faulty equipment. I just dont understand why the seller cannot test the product before sending out for delivery."

Sanjay Jain,USGDHE59FKNPTADE,03-Nov-13,1,2,1 star,Product did not work on arrival,"The card was not recognized by the computer. I lodged a complaint with Flipcart on 30th and there was no response for 4 days. I contacted Flipcart and requested a refund, they declined to do so until the vendor agrees. After escalation through feedback, a replacement was provided, which is working fine. The product seems fine for its price, but I would not strongly recommend it."
Sachin,USGDHP6ZZMVHYWT9,11-Dec-13,5,5,1 star,Waste Product,Its a total waste product. There was no freebie product given to me. Product quality is total worst. I recommend every once not to take this product. Flipkart people is not supportive on this matter... I cant give any starts to this product.
bala murugan,USGDHE59FKNPTADE,18-Oct-13,1,2,2 stars,Best Product,I have bought 2 for my pc because my motherboard sound hardware has got problem and this product is fantastic almost 3 times more powerful sound and great quality only thing i have got one faulty piece not working but i will get it in 72 hours but its great
soumalya ray,USGDHP6ZZMVHYWT9,15-Jan-14,5,5,1 star,worst product,"i was trying to increase the number of usb ports available to my laptop; so bought this one. initially, when added the datacard dongle, observed frequent disconnection. after sometime found that, this was the fault of this port hub. it was getting disconnected on its own from the laptop and causing this problem. gathering dusts now-a-days. do not buy this one."
Arvind Sai,USGDM755DTADHVCY,16-Oct-13,2,2,4 stars,Not a very good buy,"I purchased this from Flipkart along with a wi-fi router and a USB fan as i wanted to use it with my laptop, in my study desk. It was the last item to be delivered in the entire consignment."
Ram,USGDHP6ZZMVHYWT9,25-Dec-13,5,5,1 star,Damn Slow & Waste Product,System took approximately one minute just to read the contents of a pen drive and failed to read the movies folder after few minutes. It is very slow and cannot be used unless your usage is equivalent to old age Floppies. I am just wondering whether I have read the reviews or not before purchasing this.
Ajay Chebbi,USGDM755DTADHVCY,05-Oct-13,2,2,1 star,Perfect for night time work!,This is a very well designed light. The table lamp like design makes it good for night time laptop work. You can adjust it so that the light does not shine in your eyes or reflect off the screen.
Abhijit Dutta,USGDM755DTADHVCY,19-Jan-14,2,2,5 stars,nice,nice...yep thats all.

brk841991@gmai...,USGDMUGF6N4YZHUV,04-Jan-14,0,0,5 stars,dangerous product,I have bought this product from flipkart. Sound quality is so poor. There is lot of noise from it. Also my headphones heat because of it. this is very dangerous to the ears because earbuds of your earphones become very hot while using it. I also send a return request to flipkart but they cancelled my request
Baidurya Bhatt...,USGDMEZVRRYDR4HY,23-Nov-13,1,1,3.7 stars,A very useful book reading lamp,"This unit can run on either USB power or 3 AAA batteries. The battery option is what makes it a very nice reading lamp. The base houses the batteries, and clips onto the book cover. There are two heads that bend nicely over the page. Each head has two LEDs - you can turn on one or both. The swtich is at the back of each head."
Yuvraj Bajaj,USGDMUGFZZ3G4NEY,21-Aug-13,7,7,3.8 stars,Great alternative to buying a whole system for wanting more ports or if the existing ones became disfunctional.,Super light in weight yet utility at best.
Harkirat Singh...,USGDMUGF6N4YZHUV,19-Oct-13,0,0,1 star,Crappy sound quality.,I bought this because my old motherboard would start giving some weird noise sometimes & most of the time it is all good. But as soon as i played a song on this it was like .... totally crappy sound quality. Sure it is plug & play & 2.0 channel but dont expect any sound quality for music listening purposes.
Gordon,USGDMEZVRRYDR4HY,12-Oct-13,1,1,5 stars,Very useful product,"It turned out to be better than I thought. Flexible, durable and with multiple power input options (adapter,usb,battery). A usb cable is provided with the product, not long but enough for PC or laptops. Total 4 led's (quite luminous) for various levels of brightness."
Sanjeev Kumar,USGDMUGFZZ3G4NEY,16-Dec-13,7,7,5 stars,"flipkart, good. the product, no good (for me)","delivery was sooner than expected as they always do. flipkart;s delivery services are just awesome and i absolutely love the website.. and their constant progress. i have never had any complaints and never felt like writing a review except for this one. the product is all sturdy but the darn thing doesn't work. usb devices get ejected randomly. the blue led is too bright and distracting. my macbook has just 2 usb ports so i couldn't do without them hubs, i have been using belkin 4 port usb hubs for the past 2 years.. been buying a new one every 6 months, the same product everytime :| at least that worked. but nothing lasts for more than 6 monts to a year. i guess this is the case with most of the usb hubs out there. i didm;t even bother to look if the product could be returned when ordering after reading some reviews. my bad, went for it because it was cheap."

Ujval Nanavati,USGDMEZVRRYDR4HY,11-Jan-14,1,1,1 star,Decent device,"Prompt delivery by the seller, good price and reasonably good quality.

Ajit Kanale,USGDMUGFZZ3G4NEY,31-Dec-13,7,7,4 stars,Excellent Product!,Pretty good piece of electronics for 175 bucks. Has a tiny blue light to show whether the Hub is active or not. The entire thing can be switched off without having to remove the individual USB connections.
Karan Shah,USGDNUYVYMNJXZAF,19-Dec-13,1,1,4.2 stars,Stopped working within 15 minutes of use.,I bought this for my PS3 and things were going swimmingly when I plugged it in - for all of 15 minutes. It suddenly stopped being recognised by the console and all connected devices shut off.
Altaf Patel,USGDHE59NZ7FCGGG,30-Jan-14,1,1,1 star,"Short longer, not worth","This cheap device doesn't work more than few hours (not even days). Gets dimmer gradually, ending being useless. From very first day, it heats too much when using continuously for 1-2 hours. Will not recommend to use it."
