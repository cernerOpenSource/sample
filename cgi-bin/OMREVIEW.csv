RTRD7HN3B2FKYXH4,5,Prashant,2-May-12,Wow!! Just does the job.,"My first reaction was how can a router with 5 db gain be available for the cheapest price. There has to be some catch. Almost ordered a different router with 2 antennas each of 2 db gain because of price. Finally settled on this to give it a try. And was wowed. There is nothing missing. Have complete coverage for over two floors(over 3200 sq. ft) across 6 rooms. I intend to use it only for Internet connection, so anything over 10 mbps in the periphery is alright with me. And of course, it has WDS, so you can always extend it. I had a Cisco router before this. Bought only for name and boy was I disappointed.",0.92,65

I received this product today, and setting it up was very easy on a Linux machine. Took me 2 minutes to set it up to work with both my MTNL ADSL Modem, and my Tikona connection. There are a lot of useful features already, plus custom DD-WRT firmware for this model are also available. I'm hoping to try them as well soon.",0.92,65
