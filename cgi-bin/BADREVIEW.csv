DATD4VW7XF9JZFGA,4 stars,Sidhartha Sharma,08-Jan-13,"Fast Delivery, Bad Packaging, Good Product but Sim Slot is Worst","The product is good no doubt. But Problems comes in changing sim card. To pull out the slot made of very thin plastic makes the slot very much breakable by using simple force. The plastic used in sim slot is too much weak, If micromax is listning to me kindly change the sim slot. I have not seen such sim slot in my life. Even placement of micro sd card is bad. I think the overall product is good but designing is really crappy, which makes this product easily breakable. Sim Card slot and micro sd card placements should have been designed carefully as sim cards are changed by users often. But if you dont have to change the sim card and want to use single sim then this is a very good product. Speed tested in mumbai aircel 2g - Average 25kbps (Not KB its kb) highest speed in night 45kbps . Maximum speed was around 210kbps for few seconds in night at 12pm. I am scaling at 4/5. 1 point deducted due to faulty design of product (sim slot). Micromax should see that even it is providing product at competitive prices in market but customer in india still want 3 things in every product they purchase - Sasta, Sundar, Tikaauu... means cost effective, beautiful and long run. Kindly give weightage to design and longitivity of use of products may it be Cell Phones or Data Card. I hope micromax is listning, before throwing product in market check it thru experts.

This was replaced graciously by flipkart with another one which too was not working. This too was again taken back by flipkart. I decided to buy Micromax. It installed seamlessly without any hitches. I had to configure the settings for MTNL Mumbai since the setting have changed recently. The speed that I receive is unchanged. The modem dials and authenticates in seconds. No disconnections even if surfing for full day without break. Does not heat up. Suggestion, if you have an USB extension cable attach the modem to that. It slightly improves the signal. Now this is true with every modem. I have tested the sms suite and it works fine. Honestly I have not called using to modem.

But while i tried it on my home laptop which runs on Windows 7 ultimate it did gave me a nightmare. It kept on opening and closing the device folder of its own. Self installation never ran. Atlast after trying and searching over the internet for around four hours i finally got a clue that the port to which I was connecting my device needs to have a continuous power supply. Power saving feature had to be turned off from device manager and also via the power plan on which my laptop ran from there even i had to change the USB power plan.,0,0,RVBL06851YF1P6LFJ
